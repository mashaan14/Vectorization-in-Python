# Vectorization-in-Python
Vectorization refers to the style of coding where operations are applied to the whole array instead of individual elements. You can read more about vectorization on this link __[this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming)__.

## Vectorization_01.ipynb
This example shows a vectorized way on how to compute the distance from points to the centroids in $k$-means clustering.

## Vectorization_02.ipynb
This example shows a simple problem of propagating labels from $k$-means centroids to the rest of the dataset. A label will be assigned simply based on the minimum distance.
